# Classification News Using LSTM 
In this project, our main focus was on utilizing LSTM algorithms for text classification. Specifically, this project aimed to classify news articles as either hoax/fake or real. By implementing LSTM models, this project aimed to leverage the power of recurrent neural networks to analyze the textual content and make accurate predictions.

Through a combination of preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization and sequence padding, we prepared the news articles for input into the LSTM models. The LSTM architecture was chosen due to its ability to capture the sequential dependencies present in text data.

During the training phase, we fed labeled data consisting of news articles and their corresponding classifications (hoax/fake or real) into the LSTM models. The models learned to identify patterns and relationships within the textual data to make accurate predictions.

After training, we evaluated the performance of the LSTM models using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This allowed us to assess the models' effectiveness in classifying news articles as either hoax/fake or real.

Overall, our project aimed to demonstrate the application of LSTM algorithms in text classification, specifically in determining the authenticity of news articles. By leveraging the power of recurrent neural networks, we sought to contribute to the advancement of techniques for combating misinformation and promoting reliable information dissemination.
